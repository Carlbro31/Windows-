Step 1: Ensure Permissions on Sensitive Files
The /etc/ directory is where system configuration files exist. Start by navigating to this directory with cd /etc/.

Inspect the file permissions of each of the following files. You should have already done this during an in-class activity, but double check them now. If any file's permissions do not match the descriptions listed here, update the file's permissions.

Permissions on /etc/shadow should allow only root read and write access.

Permissions on /etc/gshadow should allow only root read and write access.

Permissions on /etc/group should allow root read and write access, and allow everyone else read access only.

Permissions on /etc/passwd should allow root read and write access, and allow everyone else read access only.
